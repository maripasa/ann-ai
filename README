ANN & AI Notes
===============

2025.2 notes and implementations to help me in both AI and ANN IFCE courses.
Some may prefer separate repos, but these share the same professor, so I kept them together.
Hopefully these are useful! They sure were to me!

Repository structure:

  ai/
    - My AI course implementations in Haskell.

  ann/
    - My ANN course implementations in Marimo (Python-based notebooks).

  scratchpad/
    - Loose or older notes, experiments, and implementations.
