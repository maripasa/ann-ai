# ann-ai

2025.2 notes and implementations to help me in both AI and ANN IFCE courses. Some may prefer individual repos, but these even have the same professor.

The repository has 3 folders:

- ai/
My AI course implementations in haskell

- ann/
My ANN course implementations in marimo (python based notebook)

- scratchpad/
Some loose/older notes, files and implementations.

Hope these are useful! They sure were to me!
